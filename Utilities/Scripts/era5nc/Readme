To run the program
0. Adapt the makefile with the libraries path

1. Download the files in netcdf format  in the same lon/lat extention
surface (all times and all steps): Boundary layer height, Total Precipitation, 10 metre U wind component, 10 metre V wind component, 2 metre temperature
pressure: Geopotential, Relative humidity, Temperature, U component of wind, V component of wind, Vertical velocity
invariant: Geopotential, Land-sea mask
If you want a global meteo, then set area since -90 to 90 latitude and -180 to 180 longitude

2. Go to the erainNC.f90 file:
	a. Put in the file erainNC.f90 the directories files 
	b. Set times and output name file.

3. Compile, in a terminal since the correct directory (where this program is)
4. Execute with ./../erainNC.1.x  (Maybe you need to give, manually, permission to execute. right click on erainNC.1.x, permission, click in the box to execute .)

5. The output file is saved in the same folder than the program is
